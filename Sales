#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- 1 - How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT orderID) AS number_of_unique_order_ids
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE
    length(orderID) = 6 AND
    orderID <> "Order ID";
    
-- There are 9268 unique order IDs placed in the month of January

-- 2- How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT
    COUNT(Product) AS iphone_orders
FROM
    JanSales
WHERE
    Product = "iPhone" AND
    length(orderID) = 6 AND
    orderID <> "Order ID";
    
-- The number of iPhone orders in the month of January was 379.

-- 3 - Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT
    DISTINCT(customers.acctnum)
FROM
    FebSales
INNER JOIN
    customers
ON
    FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE
    length(orderID) = 6 AND
    orderID <> "Order ID";

-- 4 - Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT
    Product,
    min(price)
FROM
    JanSales;

-- AAA Batteries (4-pack) was the cheapest product sold in January

-- 5 - What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT
    Product,
    ROUND(SUM(price * Quantity),2) AS total_revenue
FROM
    JanSales
GROUP BY
    Product
HAVING
    length(orderID) = 6 AND
    orderID <> "Order ID"
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- 6 - Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT
    Product,
    SUM(Quantity) AS total_qty,
    ROUND(SUM(price * Quantity), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM
    FebSales
WHERE

-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
